# HDCF--Disentangled-Heterogeneous-Collaborative-Filtering

# Environment
The implementation for HDCF is under the following development environment:
- python=3.8.4
- tensorflow=1.14
- numpy=1.22.3
- scipy=1.7.3


# Datasets
We utilize three datasets for evaluating HDCF: Beibei, Tmall and IJCAI. We adopt two representative metrics for evaluating the accuracy of top-N item recommendations: Hit Ratio (HR@N) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@N). Following the leave-one-out evaluation strategy, all negative samples are applied to construct the test set with the usersâ€™ all positive interactions under the target behavior type. 
| Datasets | # Users | # Items | # Interactions	| Interaction Density |
| :-----| ----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Beibei | 21716 | 7977 | 282860 | 0.1633% |
| Tmall | 114503 | 66706 | 491870  | 0.0064% |
| IJCAI | 423423 | 874328 | 2926616 | 0.0008% |


# Usage
Please unzip the Tmall and IJCAI dataset first. Also you need to create the History/ and the Models/ directories. Switch the working directory to methods/DHCF/. The command lines to train it on the three datasets are as below. The un-specified hyperparameters in the commands are set as default. Because the number of Beibei dataset is small and super imbalanced, it don't need to sample small graph and get some parameters changed. 
- Beibei
```
python hdcf_bei.py --data beibei --reg 1 --batch 32 
```
- Tmall
```
python hdcf.py --data tmall --ssl_reg 1e-6 --reg 5e-5 --keepRate 0.4 --graphSampleN 20000 --testgraphSampleN 40000
```
- IJCAI
```
python hdcf.py --data ijcai --lr 1e-4 --graphSampleN 20000 --testgraphSampleN 40000
```


# Important Arguments
- reg: It is the weight for weight-decay regularization. We tune this hyperparameter from the set {1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4, 1e-5}.
- ssl_reg and sslGlobal_reg:They are the weights for weight-decay regularization for the node-level and graph-level contrastive objectives. We tune this hyperparameter from the set {1e-4, 1e-5, 1e-6, 1e-7}.
- graphSampleN: This hyperparameter denotes the number of subgraph nodes in the train period. Recommended values are {10000, 15000, 20000, 25000, 30000}.
- testgraphSampleN: This hyperparameter denotes the number of subgraph nodes in the testing. Recommended values are {30000, 35000, 40000, 45000, 50000}.
